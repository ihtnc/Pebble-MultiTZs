Pebble-MultiTZs
===============

A Pebble watch face based on the code found in https://bitbucket.org/hudson/pebble/src/8979393cfa2a699b6408c2429e0c4074c0202fa5/timezones?at=default. 

This is also the first time I used font resources. 

I also made the watch face to respect the 12h/24h setting in Pebble.
